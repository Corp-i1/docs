## Short Term:
- 
- Make a window for playlist settings (started).
    - ~~ Add functionality for a playlist file like a json or Potential a custom file extention i dont know how difficult that might be
        to store infomation about the playlsit like volume for example ~~
    - Show Logs in the UI with filters for warning, error, info
- Add ability for custom themes
	- Provide template for user made themes
	- Add a import button for themes in settings for themes not hosted on site
        - Possibly host a place to share themes and automatic installation from within app
		- Make it possible for users to add their own themes to the site
	- Make guide for manual installation in mean time
- Make Tabs for the inspector window both the pop out and the main window.
	- Potentially to have multiple tabs open at once as separate windows / multiple inspector windows open with different tabs selected
    - Volume tab
    - loop / repeat tab
- Integrate search functionality for track selection.


                                                                        

## LONG TERM:

- Database to store playlists online
- My own FFT package
- My own audio package



## FFT Goals:

- Made in a c++ for speed and performace with wrapers for c# and eventualy python
    - May look into forking NAudio and fidiling about in c# to work out how to do it all.
- Make my own Fast Fourier Transform package
- Demo FFT Project
- Visualiser for all different types of spectograms in one function call 
    e.g. FFT.visualise(audio, type='waterfall', size(pixls)'1980,200' , Orientation'Vertical')	
    or   FFT.visualise(audio, type='waveform', size(pixls)'120,190' , Orientation'Horizontal')
- Live FFT e.g play audio from any source and see spectogram in real time
    - FFT from microphone
    - FFT from a selected audio output
    - FFT from a selected program
- FFT from audio files mp3, wav, FLAC, OGG
-


## Audio Goals:

- play audio from files mp3, wav, FLAC, OGG
- record audio
- add effects to audio e.g. reverb, echo, distortion, pitch shift, time stretch
- add fades in and out to audio
- convert to audio file from one format to another
- convert to audio from mp4, Mov, Webem 
- Potential from urls but not too sure on that one
- MIDI Support (send / recive events)
- Stero and Mono switching
- Trim files
- Merging / connecting files
- loop playback
- adjust playback speed
