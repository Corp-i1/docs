Short Term:
- Add ability for custom themes
	- Provide template for user made themes
	- Add a import button for themes in settings for themes not hosted on site
        - Possibly host a place to share themes and automatic installation from within app
		- Make it possible for users to add their own themes to the site
	- Make guide for manual installation in mean time
- Make Tabs for the inspector window both the pop out and the main window.
	- Potentially to have multiple tabs open at once as separate windows / multiple inspector windows open with different tabs selected


                                                                        

LONG TERM:

- Database to store playlists online
- My own FFT package
- My own audio package



FFT Goals:

- Made in a c++ for speed and performace with wrapers for c# and eventualy python
- Make my own Fast Fourier Transform package
- Demo FFT Project
- Visualiser for all different types of spectograms in one function call 
    e.g. FFT.visualise(audio, type='waterfall', size(pixls)'1980,200' , Orientation'Vertical')	
    or   FFT.visualise(audio, type='waveform', size(pixls)'120,190' , Orientation'Horizontal')
- Live FFT e.g play audio from any source and see spectogram in real time
    - FFT from microphone
    - FFT from a selected audio output
    - FFT from a selected program
- FFT from audio files mp3, wav, FLAC, OGG
-


Audio Goals:

- play audio from files mp3, wav, FLAC, OGG
- record audio
- add effects to audio e.g. reverb, echo, distortion, pitch shift, time stretch
- add fades in and out to audio
- convert to audio file from one format to another
- convert to audio from mp4, Mov, Webem 
- Potential from urls but not too sure on that one
