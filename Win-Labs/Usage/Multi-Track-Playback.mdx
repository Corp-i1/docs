# Playing Multiple Sounds at Once

Win-Labs allows you to play multiple cues simultaneously, letting you create layered soundscapes and overlapping effects during your show.

## How It Works

When you press the **Go** button on a cue, it starts playing immediately. If you press **Go** again (on the same or different cue) while the first is still playing, the new sound plays **alongside** the first one instead of stopping it.

**Example:**
1. Press Go on "Background Music" → Music starts playing
2. Press Go on "Thunder Effect" → Thunder plays while music continues
3. Press Go on "Rain Ambience" → All three play together

This is perfect for creating complex soundscapes, layering effects, or triggering rapid-fire sounds during performances.

## Controlling Playback

### Stop Button
Press **Stop** to immediately stop all currently playing sounds. This is your "emergency stop" button when things get too loud or layered.

### Pause Button
Press **Pause** to temporarily suspend all playing sounds. Press **Pause** again to resume where they left off.

**Note:** These controls affect **all** playing sounds at once. You cannot currently stop or pause individual sounds while others keep playing.

## The 20 Sound Limit

Win-Labs can play up to **20 sounds simultaneously**. If you try to play more than 20 at once, you'll need to wait for some to finish or press **Stop** to clear everything.

**Tips:**
- Most shows rarely need more than 5-10 simultaneous sounds
- If you hit the limit, press **Stop** to clear all sounds and start fresh
- Shorter sound effects naturally free up space as they finish

**Future:** This limit may become adjustable in settings in a future update.

## Current Behavior

### Cue Auto-Advance
When you press **Go**, the selected cue in your list automatically moves to the next cue. This means pressing **Go** multiple times will play sequential cues, each overlapping with the previous ones.

**Example:**
- Cue 1 selected → Press Go → Cue 1 plays, Cue 2 becomes selected
- Press Go again → Cue 2 plays (Cue 1 still playing), Cue 3 becomes selected
- Press Go again → Cue 3 plays (Cue 1 & 2 still playing), etc.

**Future:** There may be a setting to disable auto-advance in a future update, letting you play the same cue multiple times without moving selection.

### Disabling Overlapping Playback
Currently, overlapping playback is **always enabled** and cannot be turned off. This may become a user setting in a future update if needed.

## Common Use Cases

### Layered Soundscape
Build a complex audio environment by triggering multiple cues:
1. Start background ambience (rain, wind, etc.)
2. Layer in music
3. Trigger sound effects on top as needed
4. Press Stop when you're ready to clear everything

### Rapid Sound Effects
Quickly trigger multiple sound effects without waiting:
- Gunshots, explosions, debris sounds
- Audience reactions (applause, laughter, gasps)
- Musical stingers and hits

### Background + Foreground
Keep background audio running while triggering one-shot effects:
- Background music continues while dialogue cues play
- Ambience persists while action sounds trigger
- Underscore runs while spot effects fire
