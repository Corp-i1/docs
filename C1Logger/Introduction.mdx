C1Logger is a modern, thread-safe, and highly configurable logging library for .NET applications.  
Designed for reliability and performance, C1Logger is ideal for desktop, server, and cloud-based solutions.

**Key Features:**
- **Thread-safe**: Safe for use in multi-threaded and high-concurrency environments.
- **Asynchronous**: Logging is performed on a background thread for minimal application impact.
- **File rolling**: Log files are automatically rotated by date and/or size.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend with custom log sinks (e.g., cloud, database, or third-party services) and message formatting.
- **Syslog-style levels**: Familiar log levels with shorthand for easy filtering and integration.
- **Flexible integration**: Drop into any .NET project with minimal setup.

**Example: Basic Usage**
```csharp
using C1Logger;
C1Log.InitLog(); 
C1Log.Informational("Application started."); 
C1Log.Flush();
```


Whether you need simple file logging or advanced, multi-destination log routing, C1Logger provides a robust foundation for your application's logging needs.
