- **No logs are written:**  
  Ensure you called `C1Log.InitLog()` before logging and `C1Log.Flush()` before application exit.

- **Logging failures:**  
  Subscribe to `C1Log.OnLoggingFailure` to handle exceptions during logging. Dont worry even if you dont logs will still be writen to Console.

```csharp
C1Log.OnLoggingFailure += ex => Console.Error.WriteLine($"Logging failed: {ex}");
```


- **Log files not rolling:**  
  Check `MaxFileSizeBytes` and `MaxLogFiles` settings.
