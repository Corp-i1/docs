<Danger>**No logs are written:**  
Ensure you called `C1Log.InitLog()` before logging and `C1Log.Flush()` before application exit.</Danger>

<Info>**Logging failures:**  
Subscribe to `C1Log.OnLoggingFailure` to handle exceptions during logging. Don't worry even if you don't, logs will still be written to Console.</Info>

```csharp
C1Log.OnLoggingFailure += ex => Console.Error.WriteLine($"Logging failed: {ex}");
```

<Note>**Log files not rolling:**  
Check `MaxFileSizeBytes` and `MaxLogFiles` settings.</Note>
