C1Logger uses syslog-style log levels, each with a shorthand and a specific purpose:

| Level           | Shorthand | Description                                      |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Emergency       | emerg     | System is unusable. Immediate attention required.|
| Alert           | alert     | Action must be taken immediately.                |
| Critical        | crit      | Critical conditions, e.g., application failure.  |
| Error           | error     | Error conditions that need investigation.        |
| Warning         | warn      | Potential issues or unexpected situations.       |
| Notice          | notice    | Normal but significant events.                   |
| Informational   | info      | General informational messages.                  |
| Debug           | debug     | Detailed debug information for development.      |

## Usage Example

```csharp
C1Log.Emergency("System is down!");
C1Log.Alert("Immediate action required.");
C1Log.Critical("Critical error occurred.");
C1Log.Error("An error happened.");
C1Log.Warning("This is a warning.");
C1Log.Notice("Something noteworthy happened.");
C1Log.Informational("Just so you know...");
C1Log.Debug("Debugging details here.");

// Get the shorthand for a level
var shorthand = C1Log.LogLevel.Critical.ShortHand(); // "crit"
```

## Log Level Filtering

You can control which log messages are written by setting `C1Log.MinLogLevel`.  
Only messages at or above this level will be processed by the logger and its outputs.

```csharp
C1Log.MinLogLevel = C1Log.LogLevel.Warning; // Only Warning, Error, Critical, Alert, Emergency will be logged
```

## Custom Sink Filtering

Custom sinks can further filter or process specific log levels.  
See the [Custom Sinks](custom-sinks) section for more details.

Use the extension method `.ShortHand()` to get the shorthand for any log level.
